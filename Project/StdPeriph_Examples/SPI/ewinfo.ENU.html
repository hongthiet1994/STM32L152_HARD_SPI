SPI EEPROM

Example Description

This firmware provides a basic example of how to use the SPI firmware library and
an associate SPI EEPROM driver to communicate with an I2C EEPROM device (here the
example is interfacing with M95xxx EEPROM)

SPI peripheral is configured in Master during write and read operations from SPI
EEPROM.

The peripheral used is SPI1 but can be configured by modifying the defines values
in stm32l152d_eval.h file. The speed is set to 16MHz.

First, the content of Tx1_Buffer is written to the EEPROM_WriteAddress1 and the
written data are read. The written and the read buffers data are then compared.
Following the read operation, the program waits that the EEPROM reverts to its
Standby state. A second write operation is, then, performed and this time, Tx2_Buffer
is written to EEPROM_WriteAddress2, which represents the address just after the last
written one in the first write. After completion of the second write operation, the
written data are read. The contents of the written and the read buffers are compared.

This example provides the possibility to use the STM32L152D-EVAL LCD screen for
messages display (transfer status: Ongoing, PASSED, FAILED).
To enable this option uncomment the define ENABLE_LCD_MSG_DISPLAY in the main.c
file.

note
- The connection between the pins should use a short wires and a common Ground.

- Software Description

In master board, SPI peripheral is configured as Master full duplex with DMA
and NSS hardware mode.
The TIM2 is configured to generate 4KHz PWM signal with 50% duty cycle on TIM2_CH2
pin (PA.01), this signal is used as DMA trigger and as NSS signal input to latch
the SPI data transfers. Whereas in Slave board, SPI peripheral is configured as
Slave Full duplex with DMA and NSS hardware mode.

At each joystick buttons press:
- The Master sends the specific command to the Slave using the TIM2_CH2 DMA
  request (DMA1_Channel7)(the command contains the transaction code (CMD_RIGHT,
  CMD_LEFT, CMD_UP, CMD_DOWN or CMD_SEL) and receives the ACK command from the
  Slave using SPI_Rx DMA request(DMA1_Channel2)

- The Slave receives the command using SPI_Rx DMA request(DMA1_Channel2) and sends
  the ACK command using the SPI_Tx DMA request (DMA1_Channel3).

- The Master sends the defined NumberOfByte from TxBuffer using the TIM2_CH2 DMA
  request (DMA1_Channel7) to the Slave and receives NumberOfByte from the Slave
  using SPI_Rx DMA request(DMA1_Channel2) into Rxbuffer.

- The Slave sends the defined NumberOfByte from Txbuffer using the SPI_Tx DMA
  request (DMA1_Channel3) to the Master and receives NumberOfByte from the Master
  using SPI_Rx DMA request(DMA1_Channel2) into Rxbuffer.

- The Master compares the NumberOfByte received data with the defined ones into
  TxBuffer and check the ACK command, received data correctness is signaled by LD
  lightening and though as follow:
   - Joystick JOY_RIGHT and data correctly received ==> LD2 and LD3 ON and LD4 OFF
   - Joystick JOY_LEFT and data correctly received  ==> LD4 ON, LD2 and LD3 are OFF
   - Joystick JOY_UP and data correctly received    ==> LD2 ON, LD3 and LD4 are OFF
   - Joystick JOY_DOWN and data correctly received  ==> LD3 ON, LD2 and LD4 are OFF
   - Joystick JOY_SEL and data correctly received   ==> LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds ON

- The Slave compares the NumberOfByte received data with the defined ones into
  TxBuffer and check the received command,Received data correctness is signaled
  by LED lightening and though as follow:
   - Received command CMD_RIGHT and data correctly received ==> LD2 and LD3 ON and LD4 OFF
   - Received command CMD_LEFT and data correctly received  ==> LD2 ON, LD3 and LD4 are OFF
   - Received command CMD_UP and data correctly received    ==> LD2 ON, LD3 and LD4 are OFF
   - Received command CMD_DOWN and data correctly received  ==> LD3 ON, LD2 and LD4 are OFF
   - Received command CMD_SEL and data correctly received   ==> LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds ON


In both boards, the SPI is configured to use the slave hardware management to
manage the NSS pin.
You can refer to the Communication scope snapshot.

The SysTick is configured to generate interrupt each 10ms. A dedicated counter
inside the SysTick ISR is used to toggle the LD1 each 100ms indicating that the
firmware is running.
A defined communication timeout is insuring that the application will not remain
stuck if the SPI communication is corrupted.
You can adjust this timeout through the USER_TIMEOUT  define inside main.h file
depending on CPU frequency and application conditions (interrupts routines,
number of data to transfer, baudrate, CPU frequency...).

These operations can be repeated infinitely.

- Software Description

In master board, SPI peripheral is configured as Master full duplex with Interrupt,
whereas in Slave board, SPI peripheral is configured as Slave Full duplex with Interrupt.

At each joystick buttons press:
- The Master sends the specific command to the Slave and waits for the ACK command
  from the Slave

- The Master sends the specific command to the Slave (the command contains the
  transaction code (CMD_RIGHT, CMD_LEFT, CMD_UP, CMD_DOWN or CMD_SEL) and receives
  the ACK command from the Slave.

- The Slave receives the command and sends the ACK command.

- The Master sends the defined NumberOfByte from TxBuffer to the Slave and receives
  NumberOfByte from the Slave into Rxbuffer.

- The Slave sends the defined NumberOfByte from Txbuffer to the Master and receives
  NumberOfByte from the Master into Rxbuffer.

- The Master compares the NumberOfByte received data with the defined ones into TxBuffer
  and check the ACK command, Received data correctness is signaled by LED lightening
  and though as follow:
   - Joystick JOY_RIGHT and data correctly received ==> LD2, LD3 ON and LD4 OFF
   - Joystick JOY_LEFT and data correctly received  ==> LD4 ON, LD2 and LD3 are OFF
   - Joystick JOY_UP and data correctly received    ==> LD2 ON, LD3 and LD4 are OFF
   - Joystick JOY_DOWN and data correctly received  ==> LD3 ON, LD2 and LD4 are OFF
   - Joystick JOY_SEL and data correctly received   ==> LD2, LD3 and LD4 are ON

- The Slave after check the received command, compares the NumberOfByte received data
  with the defined ones into TxBuffer. Received data correctness is signaled by LED
  lightening and though as follow:
   - Received command CMD_RIGHT and data correctly received --> LD2 and LD3 ON and LD4 OFF
   - Received command CMD_LEFT and data correctly received  --> LD2 ON, LD3 and LD4 are OFF
   - Received command CMD_UP and data correctly received    --> LD2 ON, LD3 and LD4 are OFF
   - Received command CMD_DOWN and data correctly received  --> LD3 ON, LD2 and LD4 are OFF
   - Received command CMD_SEL and data correctly received   --> LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds ON

In both boards, the data transfers is managed using SPIx_IRQHandler in stm32l1xx_it.c
file.

The SysTick is configured to generate interrupt each 10ms. A dedicated counter
inside the SysTick ISR is used to toggle the LD1 each 100ms indicating that the
firmware is running.

A defined communication timeout is insuring that the application will not remain
stuck if the SPI communication is corrupted.
You can adjust this timeout through the USER_TIMEOUT  define inside main.h file
depending on CPU frequency and application conditions (interrupts routines,
number of data to transfer, baudrate, CPU frequency...).

These operations can be repeated infinitely.
